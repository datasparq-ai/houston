# Demo Mode

Demo mode creates a local Houston server. It then automatically creates an example API key and plan, and runs fake 
missions to demonstrate an end-to-end workflow and the Houston Dashboard.

After installing Houston with:

```bash
go install github.com/datasparq-ai/houston
```

Run:

```bash
houston demo
```

Go to http://localhost:8000 to view the dashboard. Enter the key 'demo'.
