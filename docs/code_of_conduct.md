callhouston.io is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of race/ethnicity or national origin, sex or gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, mental illness or neurotypicality, body size, caste, age, or religion. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to consider the impact of their words and actions on those with different backgrounds and experiences. We do not tolerate harassment of members of our community in any form.

The callhouston.io community is open, kind, and inquisitive.

Our community is made up of readers and authors from around the globe with diverse skills, backgrounds, and experiences. When you're reading articles, commenting on articles, interacting with members of mailing lists we host, and attending events where members of our community are present, this Code of Conduct will help inform your interactions and reinforce values that contribute to a positive environment.

Encouraging any of the above behaviour.

## Reporting harassment

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct or have any other concerns, please immediately email a member of the callhouston.io team to support@datasparq.ai. This alias goes to the members of the editorial team listed on our Meet the team page.

If you prefer to reach out to an individual editorial team member for any issues, please contact the editorial team member directly. Note: Anyone listed as an advisor, correspondent, or alumni is not notified of violations.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a necessary and appropriate response to the circumstances.

If you feel threatened or violated due to intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct, please immediately notify an editorial team member. This applies to online and in-person interactions.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

The callhouston.io editorial team has the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behaviour, callhouston.io staff and any designated representatives may take any of the following actions, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the program or event, without warning.

These actions may include, but are not limited to:

- A warning to cease their behaviour and that any further reports will result in further actions.

- Removal from an event with no refund.

- Not being allowed to attend future events for a period of time or indefinitely.

- Suspension or deletion of accounts related to callhouston.io events, programs, committees, and platforms like Discourse and callhouston.io - temporarily or indefinitely.

- Reporting behaviour to the applicable authorities.


These don't cover every possible naughty (or nice) act. We reserve the right to reject or redact any comments or posts that violate the spirit, as well as the letter, of our policies. And for good comments? Sometimes we have cookies.

Please remember to respect whatever rules your employer might have about communities like this. We want you to participate as much as possible, but not because you got fired and suddenly have a lot of free time on your hands. In fact, we'd prefer it if your employer got really excited about the site and encouraged you to learn and share here. But if they want to get involved by buying ad space, we're not selling. This site is a community. Communities are about relationships. And we'd prefer not to have to change our relationship status with anyone to "It's complicated."

That's all. Go forth and be open. If you find relevant, helpful ideas here--share them with the world. That's what this site is about.
